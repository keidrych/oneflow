# Contributing to @tayloredtechnology/oneflow

From all the existing team currently contributing to @tayloredtechnology/oneflow. Thank you for considering to join the journey of making @tayloredtechnology/oneflow even more awesome. Feel welcome as we all have all gone through the same process at one point.

There is [plenty](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow/issues) of [work](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow/pulls) available to do, and no large commitments are required, if all you did was to review a single [Pull Request](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow/pulls), then your a maintainer. And a true blue legend.

While we are all drawn here for different reasons, we all can agree that its your code that speaks on your behalf in this project. As such all community interactions abide by our simple and easy to follow [Code of Merit (Conduct)](CONDUCT.md) guidelines. By following these standard code-centric guidelines it ensures a two way messaging of respect between current maintainers and any issues or changes you are addressing with the project.

## Types of Contributions

@tayloredtechnology/oneflow being open source needs help and assistance to stay current and relevant to the dynamic shifting landscape of the open source software world. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports or feature requests or even cleaning up some of the existing code to perform faster and more efficiently. All current or proposed work is tracked via [@tayloredtechnology/oneflow's GitHub issues](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow/issues) and we suggest searching here to pick up or specify what you would like to contribute.

## Non-Contributions

Please avoid using the issue tracker for support questions. It overcomplicates the tracker makes it harder for the community to understand what should be worked on next or where they can contributed to easily. Questions raised in the issues register will be automatically closed as all support and general questions should be engaged on [Zulip Chat: TayloredTechnology#@tayloredtechnology/oneflow](https://tayloredtechnology.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116190-oneflow)

## First Time Contributors

Finding the first piece of work to contribute to can be a little daunting, as such we recommend checking out the [current open issues](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow/issues) and looking for something to grab. We follow the [Sane Labelling Scheme](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63) tailored for Kanban where _complexity_ labels identify the difficulty of the task.

**Kanban Labels**

* S ~ Under a day's worth of work
* M ~ 3 days or less worth of work
* L ~ 3 days to a Week worth of effort

The difference between _XS_ and _S_ is complexity, where _X_ identifies work would be more suited to those familar with the project or a lot of experience in the space.

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

> At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
> If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

Pull Request & Issue Templates are selected from https://www.talater.com/open-source-templates/#

# Getting started

Ensure that you have followed the [Development](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow#development) steps to get your local development environment up and running.

This project uses the [OneFlow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40tayloredtechnology%2Foneflow) tooling and workflow, allowing the core maintainers to schedule releases appropriately and new contributors to always have access to the latest stable version of the code.

Additionally [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) is used for all commit messages to ensure SemVer versioning is correctly implemented between releases.

We are striving for [100% code coverage](https://medium.com/@taddgiles/100-code-coverage-is-the-bare-minimum-6525990c02e1) and as such any opportunity to release a `HotFix / Patch` to increase code coverage is always welcome.

## Test Structure

Tests reside in the same directory as source code and are dynamically filtered to execute based on the environment. This follows the micro and nanoservice model to ensure external dependencies operate as expected:

* _spec_: are traditional unit tests. Executed only in CI & Development environments
* _api_: are external REST API calls, they operate in a dual loop, `nocked` the first execution and then executed directly against the external API to ensure eternal dependencies fail fast when breaking changes occur. Executed when Development & Production environments where possible
* _sanity_: are minimal critical path Production environment tests.

## Code Updates (Features)

1.  Create your own fork of the code
2.  Switch to the `develop` branch
3.  If you are working on a new feature run the `OneFlow` new feature command: `oneflow new feature {ID}` where ID is the GitHub Issue Number.
4.  If changing code, ensure that your modifying the respective spec|sanity|api.js test file so the unit tests pass.
5.  Complete your changes, commit as often as you need to but only commit running the command `npm run commit` or `redrun commit` instead of `git commit`. Ensure that `git add {files}` has been run first
6.  Create a pull request

Bugfixes can occur:

* as part of feature development,
* as preparation for release
* or dedicated as a hotfix as they are all automatically tracked in the changelog.

> Where possible, HotFix's should be prioritized over new features, unless as part of development the feature can address one or many HotFix's at the same time.

## Code Updates (HotFix / Patch)

1.  Create your own fork of the code
2.  Switch to the `develop` branch
3.  If you are working on a new feature run the `OneFlow` new hotfix command: `oneflow new hotfix`.
4.  Ensure that your modifying the respective spec|sanity|api.js test file so the unit tests pass.
5.  Commit by running the command `npm run commit` or `redrun commit` instead of `git commit`. Ensure that `git add {files}` has been run first
6.  Create a pull request

## Documentation updates

1.  Create your own fork of the code
2.  Switch to the `develop` branch
3.  Create the documentation and make a direct pull request with any branch name containing the word `docco`
4.  Commit by running the command `npm run commit` or `redrun commit` instead of `git commit`. Ensure that `git add {files}` has been run first
5.  Create a pull request

# I found a Security Vulnerability

> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email TayloredTechnology@protonmail.ch instead.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
>
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at TayloredTechnology@protonmail.ch

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Firstly search in the project [issues register](https://github.com/TayloredTechnology/@tayloredtechnology/oneflow/issues) to see if a similar feature has been suggested if this is the case, please read the discussion and feel free to contribute your viewpoint.

If a feature doesn't exist and hasn't been discussed to date, you are probably not alone in wanting the feature. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues register and start the discussion describing the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

Pull Requests are reviewed using the following process:

* on a weekly basis all Pull Requests passing status checks will be reviewed and merged should they satisfy the feature requirements. Its possible that a Pull Request may be delayed due to additional clarification and discussion needed.
* on a monthly basis failing status check Pull Requests will be reviewed, and originators of the pull request will be asked to bring code up to merge ready status.
